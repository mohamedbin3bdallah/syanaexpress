<div id="accordion">
  <h3>How does this Work?</h3>
  <div>
   <p>One can choose any of the available subscription plans on the BehindBars App and become a Member. Once you are a member, you can visit any of our partnered venues, scroll through the list of drinks offered at the venue, and claim anyone. On claiming it, you need to share the generated One time password with the staff and your free drink will be served!</p>
  </div>
  <h3>What type of venues are on BehindBars?</h3>
  <div>
   <p>BehindBars has tied up with the most happening bars and restaurants across Mumbai that are buzzing with nightlife. SodaBottleOpenerwala, Play-the Lounge, The Stables, British Brewing Company, Poptates are few of our partner venues. We have partners in Lower Parel, Andheri, Powai, Bandra, BKC, and soon we will be expanding to other places. BehindBars is only a marketing platform that enables the restaurants and partner venues to reach out to customers.
</p>
  </div>
  <h3>How soon after subscribing can I order my first drink with BehindBars?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You can get the party started as soon as you activate the subscription on the app. Isn’t this better than Happy Hours!</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Can I go to multiple BehindBars venues and get drinks from each?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You get one free drink every day with BehindBars. Once you have claimed your free drink for the day, you can only claim your free drink after 6am the next day. You can come back to the same venue the next day or be adventurous and try our other partner venues. </p>
   
  </div>
  <h3>Is there any minimum billing at these bars?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>A Minimum bill amount per drink claimed would be mentioned on each restaurant page. It is mandatory for the customers to ensure a minimum bill per free drink claimed is done at the partnered outlets, else the drinks would be charged for.
The amount is minimal really, so go enjoy your parties!
Example: If 4 BehindBars members go out, and the minimum bill amount for that partner is Rs.200/free drink, then the minimum bill needed for the outing is 4*200=800.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>What if the waiter does not know the concept or has not heard of BehindBars?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Please do bear with us. This concept is new for all waiters and staff at outlets. Please call for the Manager in-case the waiter denies your free drinks. Else, please write to us on support@behindbars.in or text us on +919820708321.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Are there any days when the App cannot be used?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Yes, dry days ofcourse! However, on the below days the outlets would refuse you a free drink:  Jan 1, Feb 14, Dec 24. Dec 25, Dec 31.  The list might vary from state to state. Additionally, in-case there are special days when certain outlets are not running the offer, we would be notifying our customers on their registered emails IDs.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>What about outlets having a cover charge?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>There are certain outlets/pubs that have cover charges on certain days. The members would be required to pay the same at the respective outlet to enter the place. Once a member enters the place, the free drink can be claimed as per standard norms.</p>
